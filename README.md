# CatPics
Retrieve and display cat pics using MVVM architecture, coroutines and commonly used third party libraries such as Retrofit and Dagger. A very basic UI is implemented using a RecyclerView due to time constraints. Unit testing of the Data Source class has been added and tests the retrieval and filtering logic. The filter text is current hardcoded in the DataSource but a more flexible approach to the would be implemented given more time.

Running and testing the project can be done by importing the project into Android Studio and running the app and tests as per standard procedure.
